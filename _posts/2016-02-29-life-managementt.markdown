Today is Feb 29 2016, should I do something different in the special date?  
**Yes**, I start an experimental project that is to manage/develop my life/work/study as a software project.  
The idea is to plan and track my life and career more systematic by leverage some project management tools and methods 
Here is the plan:

Tools
---
 * Trello
 * GitHub
 
Trello is SAAS that helps plan and track projects. It is a lightweight and user friendly product. I used to plan and track my projects on it.  
For this project, I will two boards for planning. One is for short term tasks that are explicit and could be finished within a month.
I will check this board periodically. Another one is for some long term tasks, like earning a new degree, finding a new job or winning the jackpot:) 
For those tasks, there are no certian deadline. The purpose here is to remind myself for those long term goals.

I will create a private repo on GitHub besides Trello boards.  
First, to leverage GitHub issue and PR features. I will submit issues on GitHub to point out mistakes or issues I had.  
Also by updating a log file day by day, I can track and write down my daily work and achievement as single person scrum.

``` python
Let's see if it will work :)
```

P.S. some interesting fact about today: If you got married today (the leap day), you will save 75% cost for your marriage anniversary.
